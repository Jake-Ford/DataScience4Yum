    "contents": "\nJaylen Brown, the monodextrous (just kidding) All NBA forward for the Boston Celtics, joins the vaunted halls of Mike Connely during waning days of the grit n grind Grizz mid-late 2010s era as the possessor of the single richest NBA contract in history. He won’t have this for long, as he soon be surpassed by other superstars including another Celtic player. Nonetheless, the numbers involved have been staggering to say the least. A five year, $303.7 million dollar extension. Thats an average of $60 million dollars per year.\nSalary Cap Increase\nFor the upcoming 2024 Fiscal Year NBA season, the salary cap is $136 million dollars. The new TV deals and whatever other shenanigans they’re doing (including a lot of amazing and not-so amazing work to globalize the NBA) results in the salary cap skyrocketing in the next ten years.\n\n\n\nBig Jumps\nThe below graph shows the annual percent change in the cap. Much has been written about the 2016 spike allowing some over powered dynasties to carry on their demonination a bit longer. But thats not even the highest spike in the last three decades; what the hell happaned in 1995-96? That’s for another day…\n\n\n\nThe Brown Case\nLets look at the top 21 salaries in the NBA over the next couple years. Obligatory laughing-out-loud moment for Ben Simmons being on this list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart shows that Brown will be in the bottom of the top 25 paid players as a percentage of cap in the 2024 season. But after that, and critically before any mega-blooper deals are paid to Giannis, Luka, and Embiid, he’ll be in the top 5 or 3.\nShould Boston fans temporarily pause in their self flaggelation over their wittling salary cap? Maybe. Or maybe it helps to just remember that while they will be attributing ~40% of their cap to Jaylen Brown for the rest of the 2020s, whoever trades for Damian Lillard and the Phoneix Suns are doing the same with Bradley Beal. Given the age difference I’d much rather be Boston.\n\n\n\n",

The drinking age is 19, what is the estimated tax revenue omitted in the United States from a drinking age of 21?\nOne of my favorite courses in graduate school was an overview of American state legislatures taught by the fantastic Chris Ross, member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for six terms. At the end of the course, we simulated the creation of the Pennsylvania state budget for a given year, debating which programs would be funded or cut, how to make sensible negotiations with political opponents, and more concretely, just how many gold egotts would be dropped off at those troublesome mavericks.\nSin taxes were all the rage at the time. Specifically, increasing state taxes on liquor (if you’re not from Pennsylvania, you need to know just how strict liquor laws once were, so this idea had some traction), tobacco, or state lotteries. The idea of dropping the drinking age below 21 would have surely resulted in a public stoning, but what if it makes fiscal sense?\nThe Northern Example\n\n\n\n",

A food tour remains the\nsingle most efficient use of condensed time to ‘see’ a city.\nBusan - something about the dichotomy between ocean and this\nmassive city skyline is surreal. I met my wife during the closing days\nof the 7th International Marine Debris Conference, so had a half day to\nmyself. The tried and true method of ordering food by pointing at\nanother person’s dish + thumbs up was further proved effective. Loved\nBusan, seemed to be a great jumping off point to other interesting areas\nalong the southern coast as well - Jeju being the most popular\nperhaps?\nSeoul’s National Museum of Korea is 1) housed in a massive and\ngorgeous building 2) would require better part of a full day to fully\nview, though can be sufficiently sifted through in a wondrous stupor\nwithin 4 hours and 3) is free! 10/10 recommend.\nGyeongju - from the population, it was much more domestic\ntravelers than international, which makes sense given the main\nattractions of Bulguksa and Seokguram Grotto, both classified as\nnational treasures. Walking through the parks in Gyeongju with the\nancient burrial mounds dotted throughout was amazing, very different\nthan the cityscapes of Seoul and Busan!\nThe distinct culture built over centuries of international\ninterference from Tang -> Mongols -> Chinese -> Japanese ->\nUnited States (apologies if that order leaves out any particular party)\nis absolutely unique to any country I’ve been to previously. For\nexample, at Bulguksa, the temple itself was destroyed by invading\nforces, and much of the scene today was rebuilt in modern times to\nancient specifications. At Seokguram Grotto, the 8th century masonry\nstill survives. At both locations, an equal level of intense pride was\nevident from Koreans. Their people are resilient and, rightfully, damn\nproud of the metropolitan wonder they have built while holding on to\ntheir history that goes back some five or six millennia.\nTransportation, ok lets talk about it. South Korea is roughly the\nsize of the state of Indiana, and it’s transportation system was nothing\nshort of stunning, efficient, fast and clean. Every metro stop had\nperfectly usable bathrooms - could you imagine this in the States! For\nall metros and buses, a single loadable card can be used across systems.\nThis part in particular blew my mind, what a convenient payment method\nfor users. I couldn’t imagine Los Angeles and San Francisco agreeing to\na unified name of a transportation system let alone a unified payment\nmethod.\nDrinking - every drink we had was based around a meal, which was\nsuch a slight but profound shift. Every night was a bit of a banger in\nour section of town, near Jonggak station in Seoul - which may be a\nfunction of the area - but sipping on soju or Korean beers over a spicy\nmeal is quite lovely :)\nStay young y’all :)\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nVapid & Plastic\nTake a stroll down any street in my neighborhood in Durham, which many on this blog have called the Mecca of the South, and you’ll quickly notice the tell-tale sign that you’re in a quickly gentrifying, liberal leaning area: the lawn signs.\nBlack lives matter. Science is Real. Housing is a Human Right. Stop the Steal. (Just kidding about that last one)\nThese signs are sometimes critisized as virtue signaling But I’m not here to argue about lawn signs. I do believe that in the broad, middle to upper-middle class Democratic base there is a pervasive hypocrisy when it comes to political priorities espoused (often via lawn ornamentation) and the actions that defend and hoard opportunities for others. I was lucky to take a seminar from Richard Reeves of the Brooking Institute on the very subject, and he’s written prodigiously regarding this very confluence of virtue signaling and policy setting. These double-standards are nearly as ubiquitous as the aforementioned lawn signs: university legacy admissions, fiscal policy such as the mortgage interest deduction, 529 plans, estate and sales tax and most recently the absurd SALT deduction - which Reeves argues should be completely eliminated, and house zoning.\nI found myself wondering, are Durham zoning laws reflective of a majority Democratic enclave, a quickly growing liberal bubble? Are we, like many other cities in America, zoned predominately for single-family households? And above all, are Durham’s zoning ordinances aligned with beliefs of all those stupid lawn signs?\nNote: Durham’s Comprehensive Plan is being updated, so zoning ordinances are likely to occur.\nEDA\nI wish I could take a time machine back to a younger Jake, complaining about a problem set in his graduate quant class. Oh, is that perfectly cleaned data set provided by the professor annoying to load into your program? Is the codebook too succint? I wouldn’t hit this Jake, violence is never the answer, but I would shake him a bit.\nThe question we’re trying to answer is to what degree is Durham’s zoning amenable to non-single family homes? Using 2020 census data, we can determine the percentage of Durham-ites zoned for single or multiple family homes. Growth in households and population will be measured based on where that growth is occuring by zone type. First, we need the zone type.\nZone Types\nDurham’s zoning data is publicly available, and is classified in an understandably long-winded manner. Below are the initial zone types:\n\n\n                     COMMECIAL                     COMMERCIAL \n                             1                            520 \n            COMMERCIAL GENERAL              COMMERCIAL INFILL \n                             3                              2 \n             COMMERCIAL_INFILL        COMMERCIAL_NEIGHBORHOOD \n                             1                              1 \n           COMPACT DESIGN-CORE COMPACT DESIGN-PEDESTRIAN BUS. \n                             2                              1 \n      COMPACT DESIGN-SUPPORT 1       COMPACT DESIGN-SUPPORT 2 \n                             1                              2 \n       COMPACT SUBURBAN DESIGN           DOWNTOWN DESIGN-CORE \n                             4                              2 \n     DOWNTOWN DESIGN-SUPPORT 1      DOWNTOWN DESIGN-SUPPORT 2 \n                             5                              8 \n                    INDUSTIRAL                     INDUSTRIAL \n                             2                            174 \n                     MIXED USE                      MIXED_USE \n                             1                             15 \n          OFFICE_INSTITUTIONAL               RES_HIGH_DENSITY \n                           247                            419 \n               RES_LOW_DENSITY             RES_MEDIUM_DENSITY \n                           447                            166 \n             RES_RURAL_DENSITY                       RESEARCH \n                           177                             13 \n             RURAL RESIDENTIAL           UNIVERSITY COLLEGE-2 \n                             1                              2 \n\nAs the songbird of our generation Carly Rae Jepson once said, let’s cut to the feeling.\nLet’s collapse each zone into broad buckets: residential, commercial, university, downtown and compact. The last two will be treated nearly identically. Compact is a newer designed zone theorized to increase density, multimodal traffic like transit and bike lanes, and allow access to work and play in and around Durham.\nThe below table from the previous Durham Comprehensive Plan shows the below table, which we will use to approximate dwell units permitted on each type of zone. Downtown zones in the ‘High’ Density have a hilarious “unlimited” density limit, so I’m expecting a new Burj Khalifa sooner rather than later with that type of free reign. Note, I will use the median value of the density ranges, but it doesn’t matter too much, as you’ll see.\n\nAfter collapsing, we get the following reduced zones below.\n\n\n Commerical     Compact    Downtown Residential  University \n        969          10          15        1223          11 \n\nThe interactive map shows these collapsed categories for the whole county. Most of the county is zoned residential, which makes sense. Commercial zones mainly follow along the major highway corridor NC 147 and I-40, along with smatterings here and there. The compact zones are relatively concentrated just north of Duke’s main campus. There are a number of condos and apartment buildings, a few hotels even, in that zone.\n\n\n\nCollapsed Zone Density\n\n\n\nMax Dwell Units by Zone\nFollowing the table shown above, the max dwell units by zone type are shown. University zones are removed for simplicity.\n\n\n\nThe units/acre map doesn’t show too much information, outside of East Durham is likely due for some expanded zoning restrictions. What I find interesting is the collapsed zone density map, the little pockets of high density in Trinity Park, where I walk my dog several times a day and fight the urge to not just allow but actively encourage Charlie the Greyhound to pee on the quarter million dollar McMansion sprouting up between the duplexes and triplexes which are clearly fit in those little pockets of high density zoned plots.\nI’m also kidding, Charlie is far too polite of a pup, and I am not one of those monster dog owners.\nWhat may help illuminate this is to see how many people are living in these type of zones.\nHeaping Cup of Demographic Data\nThe question we want to answer: how many people and households reside in the variety of zones, and how has that changed? Are zones meeting the explosion of demand in Durham?\nUsing the 2020 and 2010 census data, with some geospatial data science stacks, we can tag each residential zone type with the sum of households and total population represented.\nThe first two graphs show these results. The majority of the population in Durham County lives in low density zones, nearly a third of the total population. Downtown and Compact combined represented 11,000 population in 2020, which more than doubled compared to 2010. Households follow a similar trend.\n\n\n\n\nThe second set of graphs show the percent increase from 2010 to 2020 for each zone. Compact and Downtown saw a dramatically higher increase. These are encouraging results for these newer designed zones. But these graphs also show how supply is matched with demand in a manner. The Downtown zones saw a dramatic increase, almost twice the growth in supply compared to demand. This doesn’t immediately suggest that there is a glut of downtown households available, as the supply very well may have been rushing to meet existing, previous demand.\n\n\n\nNIMBY Score\nWorking on this section…..\nLet’s develop a super simple quantitative measure for NIMBY-ism.\nLet’s tag each zone in Durham with the population and households within the respective zone. We will then be able to see how housing supply changed from 2010 to 2020.\n\n\n\nMap new NIMBY score, which is just standardized HH_Growth from 0 - 1\nto do -\npick up where i left on 1.18.22 - the map is close, but may be useful to collapse the difference b/w the HHs and the HH’s zoned by category\nReferences\nhttps://medium.com/@NYUurbanlab/actually-nimbys-cities-arent-building-enough-51806be038ae\nhttps://abundanthousingla.org/meet-l-a-countys-biggest-nimbys/\nhttps://live-durhamnc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/zoning/explore?location=36.012451%2C-78.920767%2C15.62\nhttps://maps.durhamnc.gov/?x=36.01483037908998&y=-78.92072715568013&z=18055.9548215&r=0&b=11&pid=NA&s=zoning&l=active_address_points,countymask,transitionalofficeoverlay,NPO,NHD,LocHistLandmarks,airportoverlay,citylimits,RTPboundary,parcels,zoning,\n\n\n\n",
