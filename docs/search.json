Previously, I’ve worked in policy analysis and transportation modeling at the state and local government level.\n\nMy interests include travel, food, their very important combination in addition to writing about policy related questions in a data science framework; along with books I’m reading, podcasts I’m listening to, NIMBY attempts to Jim Crow-ify their gains in capital investments. Sometimes it’s fun, sometime’s it’s serious, hopefully more often than not it’s both!\nHere’s charlie, our rescue greyhound. You’ll probably be seeing him a lot here. Look at that snoot.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nSolstice EnergyScore, a machine learning algorithm that delivers a more effective and more equitable qualification metric. Through generous support from the Tides Foundation and Google, I spent several months investigating the degree of bias existing in the algorithm, conducting a large literature review to identify leading quantitative measures of bias and fairness in ML. The whitepaper can be reviewed here.\nAlso at Solstice, we conducted a multi-tiered analysis of community solar prioritization and barriers to LMI access. Funding was provided by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). This research looked at potential consumers, developers and financiers, and real performing solar farms. The data analysis and github page with more details and results are available here; read our paper here where I was corresponding author.\n\n\n\n",
